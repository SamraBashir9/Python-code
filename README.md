Code 1 print the word "hello" using the print() function.
Code 2  calculates the sum of num1 and num2 and stores the result in a variable called sum.
Code 3 This code checks if a number is even or odd.
Code 4 This code initializes a list called my_list containing the integers 1 through 5. It then uses a for loop to iterate over each element in the list, printing each integer on a new line.
Code 5 This code uses a list comprehension to create a list called squares, which contains the squares of the integers from 1 to 10. It then prints a message indicating that it will display the squares of numbers from 1 to 10. Finally, it iterates through the squares list using a for loop, printing each square on a new line.
